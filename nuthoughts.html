      <p>I spend most of my days with fleeting thoughts. Writing. <br>
         Listening. And collecting old Beach cruisers. The <br>
         morning rides keep me on a hill of silence.</p>
      <p>I go months without a phone.</p>
      <p>Love, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone, <br>
         but the glimmers of God speak through my music <br>
          and family.</p>
      <p>While the world around me evolves, I reflect on what <br>
         matters the most. The life in which my words will <br>
         land next.</p>
      <p>As I produce my final TDE album, I feel joy to have been <br>
         a part of such a cultural imprint after 17 years. The <br>
         Struggles. The Success. And most importantly, the <br>
         Brotherhood. May the Most High continue to use Top Dawg <br>
         as a vessel for candid creators. As I continue to pursue <br>
         my life's calling.</p>
      <p>There's beauty in completion. And always faith in <br>
        the unknown.</p>
      <p>Thank you for keeping me in your thoughts. I've prayed <br>
        for you all.</p>
      <p>See you soon enough.</p>
