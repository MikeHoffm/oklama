Okalma ( https://oklama.com/ ) was a promotional website for Kendrick Lamar's 5th studio album "Mr Morale & The Big Steppers". It has a barebones / brutalist design style & provided fans with consistent updates around the album prior to it's eventual release. 

This project allowed me to recreate the website using HTML & CSS, specifically utilizing Flexbox.
